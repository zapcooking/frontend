⚡️ Zap Cooking

Food is culture. Food is community.

Zap Cooking is a Nostr-native cooking and recipe platform built around discovery, creativity, and value-for-value culture. It is not just a recipe app. It is a place where people share food, ideas, and inspiration without algorithms, ads, or extraction.

Built on open protocols. Powered by Nostr. Fueled by people who love to cook.

🌍 What Zap Cooking Is

Zap Cooking is a decentralized recipe and food culture app where:
	•	Recipes are shared as Nostr events
	•	Identity is your Nostr key, not an account
	•	Value flows peer-to-peer through Lightning zaps
	•	Discovery comes from people, not algorithms
	•	Creativity compounds through community feedback

If you believe food connects people and culture matters more than clicks, you’re in the right place.
