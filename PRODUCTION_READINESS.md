### 4. Subscription Management
- ‚úÖ Created `SubscriptionManager` to reduce subscription churn
- ‚úÖ Implemented subscription deduplication and reference counting
- ‚úÖ Reduced frequent subscription creation/destruction
- ‚úÖ Better resource management

## üîç Current Performance Metrics

From the logs, the application shows:
- ‚úÖ Successful connection to 6 relays
- ‚úÖ Loading 35 events efficiently
- ‚úÖ Real-time subscription working
- ‚úÖ Zap processing functioning (multiple zap events processed)
- ‚úÖ Performance monitoring active

## üö® Remaining Issues to Address

### 1. Error Handling
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some components still show generic error states
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Network timeout handling could be more robust
- ‚ö†Ô∏è User feedback for connection issues needs improvement

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Large image loading could be optimized further
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Memory usage monitoring needed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Bundle size optimization opportunities

### 3. User Experience
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Loading states could be more informative
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Error messages could be more user-friendly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Offline handling needs improvement

## üìã Pre-Production Checklist

### Critical (Must Fix)
- [ ] Add comprehensive error boundaries
- [ ] Implement proper loading states
- [ ] Add offline detection and handling
- [ ] Test with slow/unreliable network conditions
- [ ] Verify all critical user flows work

### Important (Should Fix)
- [ ] Add performance monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Implement proper logging levels (production vs development)
- [ ] Add user feedback mechanisms
- [ ] Test with various relay configurations
- [ ] Add proper SEO meta tags

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Add analytics tracking
- [ ] Implement progressive web app features
- [ ] Add accessibility improvements
- [ ] Implement proper caching strategies
- [ ] Add automated testing
